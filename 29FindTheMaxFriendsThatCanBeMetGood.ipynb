        "Kurapika is long lost from his friends. He wants to meet his friends. He has total ‘n’ friends, and everyone is not available on the same day. But he can meet his friends only once. Given two arrays, ‘s’ and ‘e’, where s[i] denotes the starting date when an ith friend is available, and e[i] denotes when the ith friend will not be available after this date. Help Kurapika to know what is the maximum number of friends he can meet on one single day.\n",
